## Introduction and Objective

Dementia, an emerging complication of type 2 diabetes (T2D), may be driven by chronic hyperglycemia and insulin resistance. 
We evaluated the risk of dementia across T2D subtypes, which differ in clinical profiles and risk of vascular complications.

## Methods

We identified newly diagnosed T2D (n = 727,076; age: 64.4 years [SD:13.3], 52% female) over 2012-2023 from the Epic Cosmos 
platform and classified them into Severe Insulin-Deficient Diabetes (SIDD, 21.6%), Mild Obesity-Related Diabetes (MOD, 23.8%), 
Mild Age-Related Diabetes (MARD, 40.9%) or Unclassified (i.e., Mixed; 13.7%). First occurrence of any dementia and also 
specific risks of vascular dementia, Alzheimer’s, and other dementias within ten years after T2D diagnosis were identified 
using ICD-10-CM codes. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate covariate-adjusted absolute and relative 
hazards (HR) by subtype.

## Results

Compared with MOD, SIDD (HR: 2.25 [95%CI: 1.92, 2.64]) and MARD (2.00 [1.70, 2.34]) had higher hazards for any dementia 
(Figure). Unclassified diabetes showed intermediate hazards of any dementia (1.38 [1.16, 1.65]). Risks of vascular, 
Alzheimer’s, and other dementias were also higher in SIDD and MARD compared to MOD and Unclassified diabetes.

## Conclusion

T2D subtypes differ in dementia risks, emphasizing the need for research into tailored prevention strategies and early 
screening, particularly for SIDD and MARD.
