## Introduction and Objective

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) may be associated with higher cancer risk through chronic inflammation, insulin resistance, and obesity. 
We assessed cancer risks across T2D subtypes.

## Methods

Newly diagnosed T2D (n = 727,076; age: 64.4 years [SD:13.3], 52% female) over 2012-2023 from the Epic Cosmos platform were 
classified into Severe Insulin-Deficient Diabetes (SIDD, 21.6%), Mild Obesity-Related Diabetes (MOD, 23.8%), or Mild 
Age-Related Diabetes (MARD, 40.9%) using reliable algorithms. Unclassified cases were labeled as Mixed (13.7%). First 
occurrence of cancers (colorectal, liver, pancreatic, female [breast, endometrial, and ovarian], prostate) within ten 
years after T2D diagnosis were identified using ICD-10-CM codes. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate 
absolute and relative hazards (HR) by subtype, adjusted for age, sex, and smoking.

## Results

Cumulative cancers were highest in MOD and Mixed. Patterns for specific cancer risks differed: compared to MOD (Figure), 
SIDD and MARD had 35-111% higher hazards of liver, pancreatic, and prostate cancers but 10-36% lower hazards of colorectal 
and female cancers.

## Conclusion

Novel subtypes exhibit varying risks for different cancers, highlighting opportunities for early screening and tailored 
prevention strategies.
