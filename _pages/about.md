I am a Masterâ€™s student in Computer Science at the [University of Wisconsin - Whitewater](https://www.uww.edu/), 
advised by [Dr. Hien Nguyen](https://blogs.uww.edu/nguyenh/) and [Dr. Zachary Oster](https://cs.uww.edu/~osterz/).
I focus on designing and implementing a drone swarm communication system using microcontrollers. 
I am interested in distributed decision-making, real-time response coordination, and multi-agent interaction.
