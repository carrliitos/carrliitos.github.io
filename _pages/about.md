Hi there! I’m an Informatics Analyst at [Emory University](https://www.emory.edu/home/index.html), where I collaborate 
with researchers to lead data-driven insights that support groundbreaking research and healthcare innovation. In my role, 
I apply cutting-edge technologies and biomedical informatics standards to ensure that our informatics systems advance the 
university’s research objectives. I work closely with researchers to translate their needs into effective technical designs, 
manage complex data sets, and create accurate reports that contribute to meaningful research outcomes.

I am also a Master’s student in Computer Science at the [University of Wisconsin - Whitewater](https://www.uww.edu/), 
advised by [Dr. Hien Nguyen](https://blogs.uww.edu/nguyenh/) and [Dr. Zachary Oster](https://cs.uww.edu/~osterz/).
My Master's Capstone is focused on designing and implementing a drone swarm communication system using microcontrollers. 
My research interests lie in distributed decision-making, real-time response coordination, and multi-agent interaction.
