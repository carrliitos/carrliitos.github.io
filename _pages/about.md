Hi there! I’m an Informatics Analyst at [Emory University](https://www.emory.edu/home/index.html), where I collaborate 
with researchers to lead data-driven insights that support groundbreaking research and healthcare innovation.

In my role, I apply cutting-edge technologies and biomedical informatics standards to ensure that our informatics 
systems advance the university’s research objectives. I work closely with researchers to translate their needs into 
effective technical designs, manage complex data sets, and create accurate reports that contribute to meaningful 
research outcomes.

In addition to my informatics work, I am pursuing a Master’s in Computer Science at the [University of Wisconsin - Whitewater](https://www.uww.edu/), 
focusing on designing and implementing a drone swarm communication system using microcontrollers. My immediate goal is 
to apply advanced knowledge in Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, and Computer Engineering to drive innovation in data 
analysis and software development. 

After my master's, I aim to leverage these skills to drive tangible impacts in the field of informatics and pursue a PhD 
in Computer Science and contribute to the continued evolution of the field.
