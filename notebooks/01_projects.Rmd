## Predicting Cardiac Wellnes: Using a Multi-Layer Perceptron on ECG Data 

Utilizing a Multi-Layer Perceptron for analyzing ECG data to detect heart disease offers efficient automation, enabling 
early identification of abnormalities and arrhythmias. This approach addresses the challenges of manual analysis, 
providing consistent, objective diagnostics while enhancing the system's capacity to identify specific types of heart 
conditions.

## {magandata}

*Note: This project is currently under construction*

`{magandata}` is an R software package that aspires to unlock the inherent beauty concealed within datasets, empowering 
analysts and scientists to effortlessly craft and manipulate tidy analytic data in R.

The name is derived from the word, **maganda**, which means "beautiful" in Tagalog. Although **maganda** is pronounced 
as mah-gan-dah, you pronounce `{magandata}` as mah-gan-daytuh (or mah-gan-dahtuh if you're outside of the US).

## Contingency Management Plan

The purpose of this project is to prepare a dataset to assist in the encouragement of abstinent behavior in a drug 
epidemic. The data is to help a physician and her research team determine who is potentially eligible such that the 
patient cohort's treatment provider can approach them about interest in the study. Eligibility criteria include using 
opioids/cocaine, certain mental health disorders, and program type/date.
