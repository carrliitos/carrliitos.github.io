# Personal Projects
<!-- Data Projects -->
## Predicting Cardiac Wellnes: Using a Multi-Layer Perceptron on ECG Data 

Utilizing a Multi-Layer Perceptron for analyzing ECG data to detect heart disease offers efficient automation, enabling 
early identification of abnormalities and arrhythmias. This approach addresses the challenges of manual analysis, 
providing consistent, objective diagnostics while enhancing the system's capacity to identify specific types of heart 
conditions.

<!-- Software Projects -->
## Drone Swarm Coordination Simulation System

In this project, I developed a simulation system to coordinate and control a 
swarm of drones for various applications. The project includes the creation of 
algorithms for formation flying, synchronized movements, collaborative tasks, 
and an obstacle detection and avoidance system within the drone swarm.

## NLP - Information Extraction

In my 2020 undergraduate project, I delved into the realm of automated Information Extraction with a specific focus on 
the medical domain. The objective was to streamline the process of data extraction, automating the creation of an 
extensive database of CSVs. This initiative aimed to support proprietary research at the University of Wisconsin - 
Whitewater, contributing to the efficiency and depth of data analysis in the medical field.

## Smart Parking Assistant Arduino Project

This is a collision avoidance system placed in the garage to help people park their cars safely without hitting their 
garage walls. For this project, I am using an ultrasonic sensor to calculate the carâ€™s distance from the garage wall and 
displaying them with green, yellow, and red LEDs to indicate the presence of the car, cautioning the car, letting the car 
know it is in a danger zone, respectively.

## UW-Whiwater WINS Clone

The Whitewater Information Network for Students (WINS) is a personal online information network that is available for 
registering classes, checking financial records, viewing your Academic Advising Report (AAR), schedule, tasks, profile, 
grades, important dates, resources, and help.
