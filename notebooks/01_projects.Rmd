## Predicting Cardiac Wellnes: Using a Multi-Layer Perceptron on ECG Data 

Utilizing a Multi-Layer Perceptron for analyzing ECG data to detect heart disease offers efficient automation, enabling 
early identification of abnormalities and arrhythmias. This approach addresses the challenges of manual analysis, 
providing consistent, objective diagnostics while enhancing the system's capacity to identify specific types of heart 
conditions.

## Contingency Management Plan

The purpose of this project is to prepare a dataset to assist in the encouragement of abstinent behavior in a drug 
epidemic. The data is to help a physician and her research team determine who is potentially eligible such that the 
patient cohort's treatment provider can approach them about interest in the study. Eligibility criteria include using 
opioids/cocaine, certain mental health disorders, and program type/date.

## COVID-19 Booster Dose

The purpose of this project is to prepare a dataset to assist in the quantification of the changes in SARS-CoV-2 
antibody levels in people who received a third ("booster dose") of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Dr. Veronica Fitzpatrick, DrPH, 
explores the effects of a third dose of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine on SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in patients with Hematological 
Malignancies. This study does not require IRB (IRB# 2021-214) oversight as it does not constitute human subject research.

Ultimately, the dataset produced was used to focus on an important subset of patients with HM who are not seroconverting 
after the COVID mRNA third vaccine dose (3V). This gain in scientific knowledge is needed for clinicians to target and 
counsel these vulnerable patients.

## COVID-19 Vaccine Effectiveness

This project estimates the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccinations among the positive and negative test cases of 
SARS-CoV-2 test.

The primary objective is to develop trend and sub-population data of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and vaccine 
administration over time in one large health system.

## NLP - Information Extraction

In my 2020 undergraduate project, I delved into the realm of automated Information Extraction with a specific focus on 
the medical domain. The objective was to streamline the process of data extraction, automating the creation of an 
extensive database of CSVs. This initiative aimed to support proprietary research at the University of Wisconsin - 
Whitewater, contributing to the efficiency and depth of data analysis in the medical field.

## Smart Parking Assistant Arduino Project

This is a collision avoidance system placed in the garage to help people park their cars safely without hitting their 
garage walls. For this project, I am using an ultrasonic sensor to calculate the carâ€™s distance from the garage wall and 
displaying them with green, yellow, and red LEDs to indicate the presence of the car, cautioning the car, letting the car 
know it is in a danger zone, respectively.

## UW-Whiwater WINS Clone

The Whitewater Information Network for Students (WINS) is a personal online information network that is available for 
registering classes, checking financial records, viewing your Academic Advising Report (AAR), schedule, tasks, profile, 
grades, important dates, resources, and help.
