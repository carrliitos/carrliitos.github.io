# About

Hi there! I'm a data analyst at [Vivent Health](https://viventhealth.org/), where we care for people living with HIV.

I drive data analytics initiatives with an unwavering commitment to centering the experiences of our patients, ensuring 
that their needs and perspectives remain the focal point of our care strategies.

In addition to my analytics work, I am also pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin - 
Whitewater with the immediate goal of applying advanced knowledge in Artificial Intelligence and Big Data to enhance my 
role as a data analyst. 

Specifically, I am passionate about delving into machine learning techniques within healthcare, aiming to contribute to 
identifying challenges in patients' access to care through electronic medical records. 

Post-graduation, my ambition is to apply these skills for tangible impacts and pursue a PhD in Computer Science or 
something related, focusing on advancing healthcare analytics and contributing to the evolution of the field.
