title: "Intelligent Drone Swarm"
excerpt: "This project develops a coordinated drone swarm system using ESP32 microcontrollers and Bitcraze's CrazyFlie, 
          employing a hierarchical architecture with a **mothership** (leader drone) and **multiple child drones** (followers). 
          The objective is to achieve synchronized and adaptive swarm behaviors for complex tasks such as mapping, patrolling, 
          search-and-rescue, and collaborative exploration."

**Under construction**

Flying a single drone is hard. A swarm of them? Even harder.

That's why for my capstone project, I am using a combination of PyGame and OpenCV to control a swarm of drones.

This project aims to develop a coordinated drone swarm system using Bitcraze's CrazyFlie drones, employing a hierarchical 
architecture with a **mothership** (leader drone) and **multiple child drones** (followers). The objective is to achieve 
synchronized and adaptive swarm behaviors for complex tasks such as mapping, patrolling, search-and-rescue, and 
collaborative exploration.
