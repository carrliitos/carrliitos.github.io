title: "Intelligent Drone Swarm"
excerpt: "This project develops a coordinated drone swarm system using ESP32 microcontrollers and Bitcraze's CrazyFlie, 
          employing a hierarchical architecture with a **mothership** (leader drone) and **multiple child drones** (followers). 
          The objective is to achieve synchronized and adaptive swarm behaviors for complex tasks such as mapping, patrolling, 
          search-and-rescue, and collaborative exploration."
