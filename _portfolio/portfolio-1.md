title: "Intelligent Drone Swarm"
excerpt: "This project develops a Crazyflie 2.x drone swarm proof-of-concept, using Flowdeck V2 drones coordinated by a 
          webcam- and OpenCV-based computer vision ‘mothership’ to demonstrate real-time vision-guided behaviors for 
          mapping, tracking, and search-and-rescue."

**Under construction**

In my capstone project I develop a proof-of-concept Crazyflie 2.x drone swarm system, where multiple drones equipped 
with the Flowdeck V2 fly in coordinated patterns. Instead of a hardware mothership drone, an external computer vision 
"mothership" (implemented with a webcam and OpenCV) detects objects and motion in the environment, processes this 
information, and issues commands to the swarm. 

The objective is to demonstrate real-time swarm behaviors guided by vision-based input, enabling applications such as 
mapping, object tracking, and search-and-rescue scenarios.
